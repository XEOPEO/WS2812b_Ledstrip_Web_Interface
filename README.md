## Summary
The project consists of making a web interface to configure a specific type of LEDstrip(WS2812b).
With the interface you must be able to change the color of the strip or individual LED.

## Technologies:
* Hardware: Raspberry Pi B+, LEDstrip(WS2812b), Powersupply(5V/1A)
* Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Jinja 2
* Back-End: Python(Flask), Socket.io, rpi_ws281x

## Tasks list:

### Technical part
- [x] Search documentation
- [x] Install OS on the Raspberry Pi(Raspbian)
- [x] Install the needed services/features to the RPi(python, scons, swig, git)
- [x] Find libraries to experiment with LEDstrip(rpi_ws281x)
- [x] Make the LED work and try some selfmade python scripts
- [x] Prepare a Python webserver
- [ ] Get to know Python Flask Framework
- [ ] Create the HTML-pages
- [ ] Create the CSS-style
- [ ] Create the JavaScript
- [ ] Start coding the back-end pages/controller
- [ ] Create a link between web interface and the python scripts to command the LEDstrip
